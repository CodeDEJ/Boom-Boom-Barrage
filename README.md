# Boom Boom Barrage

When children are little, they have toys that help teach them words, shapes, and colors. There doesn't seem to be anything to teach them about music and sound. Enter the BBB.

Parents will often get children playing instruments at an early age, and there are all sorts of digital audio  for the home studio. But what if you want to ease your child into it a bit?  What if there was simple app that lets a child experiment with sound without all the hassle and complication?

The BBB is a simple sound board with 4 types of drums that your child can experiment making sounds with. Allow them to explore making music like they will making syllables. As the child advances, more features (recording, manual arrangement) can be added on.
